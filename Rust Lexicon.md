## Associated function

An associated function is implemented on a type, rather than on a particular instance of the type. Some languages call this a `static method`.

## Cargo

It is the build system and package manager of Rust. Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (more info on [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/))

create a new Rust project:

```shell
cargo new hello_cargo --bin
```

`--bin` argument makes an executable application as opposed to a library.

build the project:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

`--release` argument builds the release version of the software instead of the debug version.

run the project:

```shell
cargo run
```

checking if the code compiles, but not creating an executable:

```shell
cargo check
```

## Closure

Sometimes it is useful to wrap up a function andÂ _free variables_Â for better clarity and reuse. The free variables that can be used come from the enclosing scope and are â€˜closed overâ€™ when used in the function. From this, we get the name â€˜closuresâ€™.
Rustâ€™s implementation of closures is a bit different than other languages. They are effectively syntax sugar for [[Rust Lexicon#Traits]].

Closures look like this:
``` Rust
let plus_one = |x: i32| x + 1;

assert_eq!(2, plust_one(1));
```

We create a binding, `plus_onej`, and assign it to a closure. The closer's arguments go between the pipes (`|`), and the body is an expression. In this case, `x + 1`. 

Remember that `{ }` is an expression, so we can have multi-line closures too:

``` Rust
let plus_two = |x| {
	let mut result: i32 = x;

	result += 1;
	result += 1;

	result
};

assert_eq!(4, plus_two(2));
```

### Taking closures as arguments

We can write a function which takes something callable, calls it, and returns the result:

``` Rust
fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32
	where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {
		
	some_closure(1)
}

let answer = call_with_one(|x| x + 2);

assert_eq!(3, answer);
```

We pass our closure, `|x| x + 2`, to `call_with_one`. It does what it suggest: it calls the closure, giving it `1` as an argument.

```
where F: Fn(i32) -> i32
```

Because `Fn` is a trait, we can use it as a bound for our generic type. In this case, our closure takes an `i32` as an argument and returns an `i32`, and so the generic bound we us is `Fn(i32) -> i32`.

Of course, if we want dynamic dispatch, we can get that too. A trait object handles this case, as usual:
``` Rust
fn call_with_one(some_closure: &Fn(i32) -> i32) -> i32 {     some_closure(1) }  let answer = call_with_one(&|x| x + 2);  assert_eq!(3, answer);
```

Now we take a trait object, aÂ `&Fn`. And we have to make a reference to our closure when we pass it toÂ `call_with_one`, so we useÂ `&||`.

## Compound Types

`Compound` types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

## Constants

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, and they are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they are declared in. Constants are always immutable, and their type always should be annotated. Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not to the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

## Crate

A crate is a package of Rust code.

>â„¹ Instructions for using a crate are in each crateâ€™s documentation.
Another neat feature of Cargo is that you can run the `cargo doc --open` command,
which will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and
open it in your browser. 

### binary crate

A binary crate is an executable application.

### library crate

A library crate contains code that is intended to be used in other programs.

## Dependency Management

The packages in rust are called `crates`. You can search for the available open source crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

## Destructuring

Breaking the single tuple into multiple parts

```rust
let tup = (500, 3, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
```

## Scalar Types

A `scalar` type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters.

## Shadowing

Shadowing is different than marking a variable as `mut`, because we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

## Slice

Slices let you reference a contigouos sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. It's a data type that does not have ownership.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3];
```

## Statically Typed

It means that the types of all variables must be known at compile time.

## Panic

In Rust, for normal recoverable errors you would just return a result type in the error state from whatever function you're in. Panic is reserved for fatal errors, it's when you've hit some intractable issue like failing an assertion and the `panic handler` is where your code goes to die. ðŸ’€

## Prelude

## rustc

The Rust C compiler is a front end for [[LLVM]].

### rustc/LLVM target triple

`<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<env>`

- arch â–¶ core architecture (x86_64, i386, arm, ...)
- sub â–¶ sub architecture (ex. arm v5, v6, v7m, ...)
- vendor (pc, apple, ibm, ...)
- sys â–¶ operating system (none, linux, win32, darwin, ...)
- env â–¶ environment or ABI (eabi, gnu, elf, ...)
