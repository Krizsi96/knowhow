## Associated function

An associated function is implemented on a type, rather than on a particular instance of the type. Some languages call this a `static method`.#

## Cargo

It is the build system and package manager of Rust. Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (more info on [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/))

create a new Rust project:

```shell
cargo new hello_cargo --bin
```

`--bin` argument makes an executable application as opposed to a library.

build the project:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

`--release` argument builds the release version of the software instead of the debug version.

run the project:

```shell
cargo run
```

checking if the code compiles, but not creating an executable:

```shell
cargo check
```

## Closure

Sometimes it is useful to wrap up a function andÂ _free variables_Â for better clarity and reuse. The free variables that can be used come from the enclosing scope and are â€˜closed overâ€™ when used in the function. From this, we get the name â€˜closuresâ€™.
Rustâ€™s implementation of closures is a bit different than other languages. They are effectively syntax sugar for [[Rust Lexicon#Traits]].

Closures look like this:
``` Rust
let plus_one = |x: i32| x + 1;

assert_eq!(2, plust_one(1));
```

We create a binding, `plus_onej`, and assign it to a closure. The closer's arguments go between the pipes (`|`), and the body is an expression. In this case, `x + 1`. 

Remember that `{ }` is an expression, so we can have multi-line closures too:

``` Rust
let plus_two = |x| {
	let mut result: i32 = x;

	result += 1;
	result += 1;

	result
};

assert_eq!(4, plus_two(2));
```

### Taking closures as arguments

We can write a function which takes something callable, calls it, and returns the result:

``` Rust
fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32
	where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {
		
	some_closure(1)
}

let answer = call_with_one(|x| x + 2);

assert_eq!(3, answer);
```

We pass our closure, `|x| x + 2`, to `call_with_one`. It does what it suggest: it calls the closure, giving it `1` as an argument.

```
where F: Fn(i32) -> i32
```

Because `Fn` is a trait, we can use it as a bound for our generic type. In this case, our closure takes an `i32` as an argument and returns an `i32`, and so the generic bound we us is `Fn(i32) -> i32`.

Of course, if we want dynamic dispatch, we can get that too. A trait object handles this case, as usual:
``` Rust
fn call_with_one(some_closure: &Fn(i32) -> i32) -> i32 {     some_closure(1) }  let answer = call_with_one(&|x| x + 2);  assert_eq!(3, answer);
```

Now we take a trait object, aÂ `&Fn`. And we have to make a reference to our closure when we pass it toÂ `call_with_one`, so we useÂ `&||`.

## Dependency Management

The packages in rust are called `crates`. You can search for the available open source crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

## Panic

In Rust, for normal recoverable errors you would just return a result type in the error state from whatever function you're in. Panic is reserved for fatal errors, it's when you've hit some intractable issue like failing an assertion and the `panic handler` is where your code goes to die. ðŸ’€

## Prelude

## rustc

The Rust C compiler is a front end for [[LLVM]].
